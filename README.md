# Year In Review - An Interactive Timeline

A [Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/) driven data visualization written in [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/). 

The visualization constitutes a timeline of the events over the course of the last year, scaled horizontally to fit on a browser screen with a mouse over/touch mechanism for zooming into a given area of the visualization.

Written for use in my blog.
